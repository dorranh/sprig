# sprig-py

A minimal Python client and sprig back-end implemented in Python as a proof of
concept.

This project is primarily intended to be used as a library within Python
applications.

Example usage can be found in `[./examples]()`.

## Structure

All client code and common types are
available under `sprig.client` and `sprig.model`. The PoC back-end is mostly
self-contained in `sprig.app`.
