# sprig_ui

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Syntax Highlighting / Grammars

This project currently uses [syntax_highlight](https://github.com/serverpod/syntax_highlight) for highlighting code samples. This package requires you to provide your own grammars for ones which
it does not support out of the box. These are included as assets in TextMate JSON format
under [`./grammars`](./grammars/).
